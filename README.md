# User Guide

Welcome to Retail Store! Retail Store is an online platform that lets users browse items, add them to a cart, and experience a simulated online shopping experience.

## Features

Retail Store offers seven items available for purchase. Each item's price is displayed underneath, and users can click the 'Add to Cart' button to add items to their cart. 

To view their selected items, users can click the 'Go to Cart' button. Inside the cart, users can see a list of the items they've added, along with the subtotal, tax, and full total. Users also have the option to clear their cart using the 'Clear Cart' button.

On the right side of the cart page, users are prompted to fill in their first and last name, email address, phone number, and payment method. After completing the form, users can click the 'Buy Now' button. A confirmation message will appear, asking users to review their information. Once they confirm by clicking 'Yes,' another message will appear confirming that their purchase was successful.

**Note:** This app is a simulation. No real purchases are made through Retail Store.
